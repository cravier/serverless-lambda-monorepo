# Serverless Framework Node HTTP API on AWS

Serverless credentials and profile per stage documentation : [here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials#using-aws-access-keys)

## Monorepo

This repo is built as a mono repo: under the `src` repository you will be able to find all the micro services, with a `serverless.yml` for each of them. The shared code is located under the `src/lib` directory.

### Rules

In this kind of monorepo it is really important to understand that if the code of a shared file is altered, all the services 

### Turborepo

Trigger the info script for each services

```

```

## Usage

### Setup AWS credentials

Create an access key in the serverless platform:
````
https://app.serverless.com/[username]/settings/accessKeys
````

Then
```
$ vi ~/.aws/credentials

[serverless-lambda-monorepo]
aws_access_key_id=***************
aws_secret_access_key=***************
```

You can add ass many profile as you want

### Deployment

```
$ serverless deploy
```

After deploying, you should see output similar to:

```
serverless info
```

_Note_: In current form, after deployment, your API is public and can be invoked by anyone. For production deployments, you might want to configure an authorizer. For details on how to do that, refer to [http event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway/).

### Local development

You can invoke your function locally by using the following command:

```bash
serverless invoke local --function api
```

Which should result in response similar to the following:

```
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": "{\n  \"message\": \"Go Serverless v3.0! Your function executed successfully!\",\n  \"input\": \"\"\n}"
}
```


Alternatively, it is also possible to emulate API Gateway and Lambda locally by using `serverless-offline` plugin. In order to do that, execute the following command:

```bash
serverless plugin install -n serverless-offline
```

It will add the `serverless-offline` plugin to `devDependencies` in `package.json` file as well as will add it to `plugins` in `serverless.yml`.

After installation, you can start local emulation with:

```
serverless offline
```

To learn more about the capabilities of `serverless-offline`, please refer to its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline).
